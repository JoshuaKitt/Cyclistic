## Data Understanding
* Casual riders prefer to ride over the weekend and reach peak usage later in the day between 2pm-6pm.
* Casual member usage increases over the span of the day and peaks at 5pm. This indicates that it willmost likely be students, tourists and other urban commuters using this service.
* Highest volume of usage appears to be towards the coastal area near the Navy Pier.
## Conclusion
* Promotion and advertising of cyclistic bikes should be targetted on the weekends in the afternoon andinto the evening. The bike promoted should be either the electric or classic cycle.
* Marketing campaigns should focus on advertising to students either at campuses or studentaccommodation. Social media could also be used for this age group.
